It is not only enriched with calcium and vitamin D, but also essential nutrients that promote health.

<h2><font color="red">2. Keeps Your Body Hydrated</h2></font>

<h3><font color="blue">Cold milk is a great beverage to keep your body hydrated. Dehydrating beverages like alcohol, coffee and sugary foods signal the kidneys to get rid of the extra water by producing more urine making you feel more dehydrated. However, when beverages contain nutrients and electrolytes like potassium and sodium, as milk does, the stomach empties slowly with less significant effect on the kidneys.
