Indian cuisine is inextricably interwoven with spices. One such spice that makes way into most of our curries, stews and sabzi is black pepper. Its earthy aroma and flavourful taste can turn some of the most dull dishes into lip-smacking treats. But there's much more that black pepper can do, in addition to making your food flavoursome. Turns out, that the hot and pungent spice may also help you shed a pound or two! Black pepper is a storehouse of health benefits and effective weight loss and metabolism is one of them. The desi super food is packed with Vitamin A, K, C, and minerals like calcium, potassium and sodium. Black pepper is also rich in healthy fats and dietary fiber which helps promote weight loss too.
How Does Black Pepper Help In Weight Loss?
 Macrobiotic Nutritionist and Health Practitioner Shilpa Arora ND says, "Black pepper contains piperine, a compound that enhances metabolic performance and suppresses fat accumulation in the body. Black pepper tea works very well in managing obesity. Black pepper also helps in the absorption of nutrients in the body. It helps strengthen immunity and fights against infections too."
